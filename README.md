# CovidPrediction

Overview: This is a Deep Learning project involving the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's).

What it does: When Chest X-ray samples are provided to the model, it is capable enough of predicting whether the patient is COVID-19 infected or not.

How efficient, you may ask? Well, the model obtains an accuracy of about 92% on validation data. Not only that, it also plots a 2D heatmap that focuses on the infected regions and 
superimposes it on top of the input X-ray.
